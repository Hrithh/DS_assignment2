# Weather Aggregation System â€“ DS Assignment 2

This project implements a **Distributed Weather Aggregation System** using Java. It simulates a set of weather **Content Servers (replicas)** that send weather data to a central **Aggregation Server**, which serves **Clients** via `GET` requests. The system supports **Lamport Clocks**, **fault tolerance**, and **record expiry** logic.

## Requirements

- **Java 11.0.28 (LTS)**
- **Maven 3.9.9**
- vendor: Eclipse Adoptium

---

## Dependencies

- Managed via pom.xml:
- gson (Google JSON)
- Java standard libraries (no external REST frameworks used)

## How to Run the System

Make sure you're inside the `DS_AT2` project root.

### 1. **Start the Aggregation Server**

mvn exec:java "-Dexec.mainClass=au.edu.adelaide.ds.assignment2.AggregationServer"

### 2. **Start a Content Server (Replica)**

You can run multiple replicas using different IDs and input files

first replica
mvn exec:java "-Dexec.mainClass=au.edu.adelaide.ds.assignment2.ContentServer" "-Dexec.args=replica1 weather1.txt"

second replica
mvn exec:java "-Dexec.mainClass=au.edu.adelaide.ds.assignment2.ContentServer" "-Dexec.args=replica2 weather2.txt"

Each Content Server:
- Reads local weather data from a file
- Embeds a Lamport timestamp
- Sends data via a PUT request to the Aggregation Server

### 3. **Start the Client**

mvn exec:java "-Dexec.mainClass=au.edu.adelaide.ds.assignment2.GETClient"
